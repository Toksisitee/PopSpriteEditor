### Usage
Usage is straight forward. The numbering (names) of the bitmaps is the order they'll be saved in, and any gaps in the numbering isn't a problem as the editor will renumber the files internally. Files that aren't bitmaps or bitmaps with letters in the name will be ignored.
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Toksisitee/PopSpriteEditor/releases).
2. Ensure `pal.dat` is located in the same folder as the software.
3. Open a valid bank `File` -> `Open` from the game's `data` folder.
4. Export all sprites within the bank `File` -> `Export Sprites`.
5. Open the newly created folder `output` (editor folder), it should contain all saved sprites.
6. Modify (resolution and/or colors), delete or add new bitmaps.
7. Create a new bank from these bitmaps `File` -> `Create Sprite Bank` -> `From Images`.
8. Replace the original game's sprite bank with the newly created one.

### Sprite Sheets
A valid sprite sheet has to abide by the following rules:
* Sprites can't touch corners or edges; ensure there's a space between of at least 1 pixel.
* New rows have to be separated by a pink continuous line.
* Background color has to be cyan. (RGB: 0, 255, 255)
* Color key color has to be pink. (RGB: 255, 0, 255)
