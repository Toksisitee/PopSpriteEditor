  - View offset, index, width, height and raw data of each sprite.
- Create banks:
  - From bitmaps of any width & height.
  - Append or insert to an "existing" bank.
  - Modify original sprites width & height.
- Color Palette:
  - Preview color palette.
  - Adjustable color key.
- Pixel Inspector; hover over an image and a tooltip will appear showing the highlighted pixel's values:
	- Position (current width & height).
	- RGB values.
	- Index in the color palette.
	- Right click to copy RGB values.
- Basic editing functionality:
	- 2 color slots (right/left click).
	- Brush mode; paint individual pixels (r/l click).
	- Color pick mode; copy RGB values from highlighted pixel (r/l click).
	- ``CTRL + Z`` (undo).

### Usage
Usage is straight forward. The numbering (names) of the bitmaps is the order they'll be saved in, and any gaps in the numbering isn't a problem as the editor will renumber the files internally. Files that aren't bitmaps or bitmaps with letters in the name will be ignored.
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Toksisitee/PopSpriteEditor/releases).
2. Ensure `pal.dat` is located in the same folder as the software.
3. Open a valid bank `File` -> `Open` from the game's `data` folder.
4. Export all sprites within the bank `File` -> `Export Sprites`.
5. Open the newly created folder `output` (editor folder), it should contain all saved sprites.
6. Modify (resolution and/or colors), delete or add new bitmaps.
7. Create a new bank from these bitmaps `File` -> `Create Sprite Bank` -> `From Images`.
8. Replace the original game's sprite bank with the newly created one.
